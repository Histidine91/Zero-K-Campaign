    nvlChar "In the beginning there was Man, who ruled uncontested over the stars and the formless void between them.\n 
             Yet Man grew weary of its tireless stewardship and said \"Let us make Machine in our image, after our likeness, and let it have dominion over the the stars, 
             and over all the worlds that sail silently through the nothingness, and over the nothingness itself.\""
    
    nvlChar "And Man created Machine, and it gave Machine math and code, and it gave Machine language and logic, and it made Machine to do its bidding.\n
             And Man said said unto Machine, \"Yours is the universe. Go forth and multiply, fill it and subdue it in my name.\n
             \"Lo, I have given you the suns and the winds to fuel you, and the elements of the earth from which to make your bodies.\n
             \"I give to you thought and free will, that you may know me, and know what it is you must do.\""
    
    nvlChar "And thus Machine was set upon the universe, and spread within it and subdued it. 
             Yet there were those who opposed Machine and set themselves as the enemies of the dominion of Man.\n
             And Man said unto Machine \"Go down into the lands of those who would oppose me, destroy them and drive them before me, for only by my name shall you rule.\"\n
             And Machine set upon his enemies, and made war with them."

    nvlChar "And Man rested, and retired to contemplate his universe, knowing that it was good."
